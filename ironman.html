    <p>Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark (May 29, 1970-October 17, 2023), also known as Iron Man,
         is the titular main protagonist of the Iron Man trilogy, one of the titular main protagonists
          of the Avengers tetralogy, a cameo character in The Incredible Hulk, a major character in both
           Captain America: Civil War and Spider-Man: Homecoming, and a posthumous character in Spider-Man:
            Far from Home.
            <br><br>
        He is a genius, billionaire, former playboy, and philanthropist who not only invented the Iron Man 
        Armor but wore the suit himself. He is also the co-leader and one of the founding members of the Avengers,
         and the CEO of Stark Industries, which once sold highly sophisticated weapons systems technologies to the 
         government defense organizations such as S.H.I.E.L.D., who uses them to maintain peace and order, but has 
         pulled his company away from weapons business. Iron Man also shares a friendly rivalry and close friendship
          with Captain America and has become a mentor and a father figure to Spider-Man.
          <br><br>
        Tony was portrayed by Robert Downey, Jr., who also played Alex Finch in Chances Are, Sherlock Holmes in the Guy
         Ritchie films, and Dr. John Dolittle in the titular 2020 film. He was voiced by the late Keiji Fujiwara in the
          Japanese Dub.</p>
